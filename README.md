# Employee-Burnout-Prediction
Employee burnout is a significant issue affecting productivity, job satisfaction, and overall well-being. With the growing awareness of mental health in the workplace, predicting and preventing burnout has become a priority for many organizations. This project aims to develop a system for predicting employee burnout using machine learning techniques. The following sections provide an overview of the project's features, technologies used, and instructions for setting up and running the project.

Introduction:

Burnout is a state of emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged stress. It can lead to decreased productivity, cynicism, and feelings of detachment from the job. Early prediction of burnout can help in taking proactive measures to improve employee well-being and productivity.

Features:

Data Collection: Gather data from various sources such as surveys, HR records, performance metrics, and attendance logs.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Create new features from the raw data that could be indicative of burnout, such as workload, work-life balance, and employee engagement scores.

Model Training: Train machine learning models using historical data to predict burnout. Common algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC to select the best-performing model.

Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python

Libraries and Frameworks:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis

Scikit-Learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics
